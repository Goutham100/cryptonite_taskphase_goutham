# some assembly required

flag: `picoCTF{c733fda95299a16681f37b3ff09f901c}`

My Approach to the problem
- as always I started with inspecting the page source then i came across this file: ![img_8.png](../images/img_8.png) which asked to refresh the page
- so I refreshed it , I was met with webassembly code which had the flag at the end
