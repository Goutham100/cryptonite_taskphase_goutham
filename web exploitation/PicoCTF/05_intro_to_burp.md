# intro to burp

flag: `picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_c94b61ac}`

My Approach to the problem:
- i tried putting in random values in the input column and pressing register
- i tried intercepting the GET and POST requests using burp suite
-  now to ge the flag we have to get past the 2-factor authentication
- in order to do that we have to find the otp element in the post request  by intercepting in the burpsuite and removing it and forwarding the request
-  after that we are greeted with this: ![img_5.png](img_5.png)
